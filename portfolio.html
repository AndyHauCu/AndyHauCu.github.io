             <p id="resumelink"><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/256573495/">CLick Here to Play</a></p>
             <hr id="resumeline">     <!-- Remember to make this line shorter on both sisdes -->
             <p id="resumemeat">The main and only goal of Spider Escape is to evade the spiders and run as far as possible,<br>
             the farther ypu run the more points you accumulate, but in the end there is no way to win, <br>
             the game goes on for as long as you are capable of doing so.</p>
             <p id="resumecenter">The Criteria</p>
             <hr id="resumeline">
             <p id="resumebold">Scoring System</p>
             <p id="resumeclass">Whenever you reach the edge of your screen, you move to another portion of the map,<br>
             whenever this transition occurs, you gain a point, your score is visible by a counter.</p>
             <br>
             <p id="resumebold">Randomness</p>
             <p id="resumeclass">Whenver you transition to another portion of the map, four spiders spawn at random places<br>
             on the map.</p>
             <br>
             <p id="resumebold">Difficulty Change</p>
             <p id="resumeclass">If you decide to press on the "hardmode" button, you will accumulate half as many points</p>
             <br>
             <p id="resumebold">Losing</p>
             <p id="resumeclass">Whenever you touch a spider, you "die", in other words, everything besides the music stops<br>
             and a death screen is shown.</p>
                <p id="resumecenter">Reflection</p>
                <hr id="resumeline">
                <p id="resumebold">Why this game idea?</p>
                <p id="resumeclass">I chose this idea because I was recently playing the "Dark Souls" series, which is famous<br>
                for being extremely difficult.  There was this one area with a ton of spiders, and instead of <br>
                fighting, I ran past, and it was the most difficult part of the game for me.  Thus, this game.</p>
             <br>
             <p id="resumebold">Successes</p>
                <p id="resumeclass">One of the prominent successes that really boosted my self esteem was getting the home<br>
                screen to work, another success was actually drawing all of my animations, pixel by pixel.</p>
             <br>
             <p id="resumebold">Obstacles</p>
                <p id="resumeclass">One of the prominent obstacles that really killed my self esteem was the A.I, and rigging<br>
                the animations to work with the movement of my character.</p>
             <br>
             <p id="resumebold">Theoretical Improvements</p>
                <p id="resumeclass">I would add an attack, shield, and stamina, along with improving the enmy A.I and such.</p>

             <p id="resumeclass">This script is an algorythm because it's a step by step procedure that includes iterations<br>
                conditionals, and mathematical / logical codes.  This script is responsible for the movement<br>
                of the player character.</p>
