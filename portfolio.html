             <p id="resumelink"><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/256573495/">CLick Here to Play</a></p>
             <hr id="resumeline">     <!-- Remember to make this line shorter on both sisdes -->
             <p id="resumemeat">The main and only goals of Spider Escape is to evade the spiders and run as far as possible,<br>
             the farther ypu run the more points you accumulate, but in the end there is no way to win, <br>
             the game goes on for as long as you are capable of doing so.</p>
             <p id="resumecenter">The Criteria</p>
             <hr id="resumeline">
             <p id="resumebold">Scoring System</p>
             <p id="resumeclass">Whenever you reach the edge of your screen, you move to another portion of the map,<br>
             whenever this transition occurs, you gain a point, your score is visible by a counter.</p>
             <br>
             <p id="resumebold">Randomness</p>
             <p id="resumeclass">Whenver you transition to another portion of the map, four spiders spawn at random places<br>
             on the map.</p>
             <br>
             <p id="resumebold">Difficulty Change</p>
             <p id="resumeclass">If you decide to press on the "hardmode" button, you will accumulate half as many points</p>
             <br>
             <p id="resumebold">Losing</p>
             <p id="resumeclass">Whenever you touch a spider, you "die", in other words, everything besides the music stops<br>
             and a death screen is shown.</p>
                <p id="resumecenter">Reflection</p>
                <hr id="resumeline">
                <p id="resumebold">Why this game idea?</p>
                <p id="resumeclass">I chose this idea because I was recently playing the "Dark Souls" series, which is famous<br>
                for being extremely difficult.  There was this one area with a ton of spiders, and instead of <br>
                fighting, I ran past, and it was the most difficult part of the game for me.  Thus, this game.</p>
             <br>
             <p id="resumebold">Successes</p>
                <p id="resumeclass">One of the prominent successes that really boosted my self esteem was getting the home<br>
                screen to work, another success was actually drawing all of my animations, pixel by pixel.</p>
             <br>
             <p id="resumebold">Obstacles</p>
                <p id="resumeclass">One of the prominent obstacles that really killed my self esteem was the A.I, and rigging<br>
                the animations to work with the movement of my character.</p>
             <br>
             <p id="resumebold">Theoretical Improvements</p>
                <p id="resumeclass">I would add an attack, shield, and stamina, along with improving the enmy A.I and such.</p>

            <p id="resumemeat">In Escape Lothric, you are a knight that has commited treason, therefore you are a<br>
             fugitive escaping from the king's guards.  In this adventure you'll face many obstacles.<br>

            <p id="resumemeat">Throughout the developement process, we encountered many issues, the inclusion of<br>
            an item sytem for one, as the mathematics were difficult to say the least. This was solved<br>
            by eliminating the mathematics, this was done in small parts making it incemental. The second
            part was the indentation glitch on replit, it was a tedious process that was done man times,<br>
            messing us up a lot, we fixed it by re-indenting, doing this multiple times makes it iterative<br<br>
            considered procedural abstraction because the instead of writing the code out over and over<br>
            It was abstracted by hiding all the code in function within functions. So while the code is<br>
            being executed, it ignores the code and follows the functions. The two stories I enjoyed were<br>
            "The Journey to Pynsthena, it was by far most well made with lots of mathematics. Other than<br>
            that, "Twinkie Reflection" was pretty great, many unexpected turn that made me think about<br>
            my existance, it was nice.</p>
